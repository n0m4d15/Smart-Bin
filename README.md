# Smart-Bin A-Smart-India-Initiative
***Smart Bin*** is an IoT based Real-Time Public Garbage Monitoring System. It collects significant data required to determine the status of the Waste Bins and notifies the sanitation authorities in real time.

***Concept:*** This is a Smart India Initiative. Consider there are 1000 Public bins in and around the City. With Smart Bin, if only 100 bins are full, the application dedicated for the authorities will generate a route only to the necessary bins. This saves time and is more efficient than the current conventional method.

***My Vision:*** This is a passion project and everything will be open source. So anyone can Implement this idea. The vision is to develop a culture around using technology for the betterment and not to with-hold any ideas that can potentially change the way we perseve the world.

***Version: v0.01 (as of last push)***

***Sensors:*** Lid Status, Fill Level, Toxicity/Flammability Status, GPS, Load on Bin, GSM Module

***Actuators:*** Servo/Stepper motor for automatically closing the Lid when unattended

***Central node:*** Arduino nano on EACH Bin.

**More Updates Coming Soon...**
